# PasswordStrengthEvaluator
This Python program assesses the strength of a provided password using a scoring mechanism. The evaluation considers factors such as password length, the inclusion of lowercase and uppercase letters, the presence of non-alphabetic characters, and the lengths of consecutive sequences of both lowercase and uppercase letters.
